# Optimised-WABC-for-Influence-Maximisation
Here I have implemented Weighted Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for heuristically solving the Influence Maximisation problem. I have optimised the implementation by using multi-source Dijkstra algorithm. I have also developed some other tools like graph generator, monte carlo simulator etc. to test the algorithm and optimize the parameters.
